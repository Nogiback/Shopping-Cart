# Shopping-Cart

[React - Shopping Cart Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart#solutions)

This is the capstone React project under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to build a simple shopping/e-commerce website utilizing the skills learned throughout the React course (e.g. hooks, routers, etc).

## Demo

## Built With

React, TailwindCSS, React Router, React Testing Library, Jest, Vite, Vercel, ESLint, Prettier

## Lessons Learned

I learned the importance of planning before you start building! Throughout the duration of the project, I would often make design changes prior to getting the site's functionality done. While this was not the most efficient method, I had a lot of fun going back and forth. I also decided to learn Tailwind for this project and highly enjoyed it! It allowed me to style components quickly, however it does bloat my JSX files!
